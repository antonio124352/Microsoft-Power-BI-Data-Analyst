Adventure Works: Operational AI & Logistics Report
Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI

Project Overview
This project was developed to address an urgent request from the Adventure Works executive team. The primary goal was to consolidate fragmented sales, customer, and inventory data into a single interactive report, enabling leadership to forecast trends and interact with data using natural language.

Key Technical Skills Applied
Self-Service BI (Q&A): Implemented AI-driven natural language processing to allow stakeholders to query data directly.

Advanced Analytics & Forecasting: Applied statistical models to predict future sales trends with a 99% confidence interval.

Operational Reporting: Monitored the delivery pipeline by visualizing real-time order statuses (Shipped, Processing, Cancelled).

UX/UI Optimization: Focused on executive readability using a unified theme (#2D386D), custom tooltips, and accessibility features.

Project Workflow
1. Core Visualizations & Logistics
Delivery Pipeline Table: A detailed view crossing Product IDs, names, and order statuses, allowing management to track products through the logistics flow.

Product Category Performance: A column chart sorted by revenue, identifying that Kids Bikes require a strategic revisit due to low sales volume ($500).

2. Time Intelligence & Predictive Analysis
Sales Trends & Peak Analysis: A line chart designed to identify seasonal revenue fluctuations and historical peaks.

Forecasting: Configured monthly seasonality (12 months) to anticipate sales drops, such as the one identified for March 27th, 2023.

3. AI-Driven Insights (Q&A)
Integrated a conversational interface to provide instant insights without manual filtering:

Top Performing Categories: Identified that BMX Bikes have the highest average order quantity.

Geographical Insights: Discovered that Long Beach represents the lowest average order total ($1,200).

Logistics Specs: Quick queries regarding product weight (e.g., Downhill subcategory having the highest weight at 151oz).

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The report highlights three critical metrics for global expansion:

Total Revenue: Tracked via KPIs to monitor sales goal attainment.

Customer Reach: Unique customer count to measure brand loyalty and expansion.

Geographic Footprint: Total city count to track the brand’s global presence.

Note: This project demonstrates the ability to transform disjointed raw data into a compelling business narrative, empowering decision-makers with AI-assisted tools.
