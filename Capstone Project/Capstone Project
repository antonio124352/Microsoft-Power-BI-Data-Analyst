Microsoft Power BI Capstone Project: Tailwind Traders
Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate

Project Overview
This Capstone project simulates a real-world business scenario for a global company, Tailwind Traders. The goal was to transform raw sales and inventory data from multiple sources (Excel and Python) into a comprehensive Business Intelligence ecosystem focused on global profit metrics and performance analysis.

Key Technical Skills Applied
Data Preparation (Excel & Power Query): Data cleaning, normalization, and creation of net revenue calculations.

Complex Data Modeling: Implemented a Snowflake Schema with 1:1 and 1:N bi-directional relationships.

DAX Engineering: Developed advanced calculated measures for Time Intelligence and dynamic currency conversion to USD.

Storytelling & Visualization: Designed Executive Dashboards and reports optimized for both Desktop and Mobile View.

Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)
Excel: Manual preparation of Gross Revenue, Tax, and Net Revenue columns using business formulas.

Power Query: Data type optimization, filtering of refunds (ReturnStatus), and column quality analysis to ensure 100% data integrity.

2. The Data Model (Snowflake Schema)
The model was architected to support complex global financial analysis:

Calendar Table: Created via DAX (CALENDAR) to enable temporal analysis (Yearly/Quarterly).

Currency Conversion: Engineered a calculated table Sales in USD to consolidate global metrics into a single base currency.

Relationships: Configured bi-directional cross-filtering between Sales, Countries, Purchases, and Exchange Data to ensure seamless data flow.

3. DAX Measures (Business Logic)
Developed mission-critical metrics for executive decision-making:

Yearly Profit Margin: Built using DIVIDE and SUM for accurate ratio reporting.

Time Intelligence: Utilized TOTALYTD and DATESQTD for Year-to-Date and Quarterly profit tracking.

Statistical Stability: Applied the MEDIAN function to assess sales performance stability and identify outliers.

4. Visual Reports & Executive Dashboard
The project features three main reporting layers:

Sales Overview: Analysis of loyalty points by country, quantity sold by product, and median sales trends.

Profit Overview: Detailed breakdown of profit margins, YTD profit, and Net Revenue by product.

Executive Dashboard: A high-level curated view of KPIs, specifically designed for Mobile Layout to ensure stakeholders can access insights on the go.

Optimization & Performance
Performance Analyzer: Validated all report visuals to ensure DAX query times remain below 200ms.

Data Integrity: Verified 100% column quality for key fields like OrderID and Warranty.

Proactive Monitoring: Configured data alerts and subscriptions to empower stakeholders with timely insights.

Note: This project is part of the Microsoft Professional Certificate and demonstrates full proficiency in the end-to-end Power BI Data Analyst workflow.
